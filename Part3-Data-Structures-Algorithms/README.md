### Final Lab - Java Book Search Engine

This project is a console-based Java application that simulates a basic search engine for a digital library. It allows users to search, view, sort, and manage a collection of books stored in a text file. The project integrates key programming concepts such as file I/O, data structures, sorting/searching algorithms, user interfaces, logging, and serialization. 

**Key tasks: implementing the Linear Search and Bubble Sort.**

## Introduction to Software Development

### Structure of course

Part1-Syntax-and-OOP/          
- Module1-Syntax-Basics
- Module2-Loops-and-Methods   
- Module3-Classes-and-Objects
- Module4-FinalLab-Creating-a-Zoo

Every module features a **GradedLab** or lastLab that tests the concepts covered. 

### Final Lab - Zoo Project

The Module 4 it is a **final graded project**. The project includes an abstract Animal class and two specific animals: a tiger and a dolphin. 
I used inheritance to share common functionality and implemented several interfaces to reflect realistic behaviors.

Additionally, I demonstrated composition with a third class, Penguin, which combines behaviors from both land and water animals.


### Topic covered

- **Java syntax:** if-else statement, switch case, while-do-for loop, arrays, methods 
- **OOP:** Classes, Interfaces, Objects, Abstraction, Incapsulation, Heritance, Polymorphism, Composition

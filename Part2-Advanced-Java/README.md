**Final Lab – Java Animal Data Serialization**

This project is a console-based Java application that extends a previous animal classification program by adding file I/O and serialization. It allows users to save and load data for Tiger, Penguin, and Dolphin objects, making the data persistent across sessions.

**Key tasks:** making classes serializable, overriding toString(), implementing save/load methods for each animal, and enhancing the menu with data persistence options.
